# Draw2Cut Project

**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 1. Installation

This project uses `poetry` for environment management. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using `Anaconda` or `venv`.

2. Install `poetry` and project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

### External Dependencies

The project requires the external library `zbar`. Install it using the commands below:

- **For Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libzbar0
  ```

- **For Mac**:
  ```bash
  brew install zbar
  ```

### Depth Camera Support

The current `pyproject.toml` does not include `pyrealsense2`. If you need depth camera support, install it manually:

- **Note**: This library is not compatible with macOS.
  
  ```bash
  pip install pyrealsense2
  ```

If depth camera functionality is not required, you can skip this step.

## 2. Interface

Run the following command to launch the interface:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Notes for Ubuntu Users:
- **Library Errors**: Additional libraries may need to be installed if you encounter errors.

- **Display Scaling**: Layout issues may arise if the display scaling is not set to 100%.

## 3. Steps for Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Point Cloud

1. Click **Start Capture** to simultaneously capture color and depth images.

2. Switch visualization modes using:
   - **Show Depth**
   - **Show Color Image**

---

### Step 2: Separate Cutting Surface

1. Select the relevant case.

2. Click **Show Collected Point Cloud** to view data from Step 1.

3. Adjust parameters and click **Start Separation** to segment the cutting surface. The result will appear in the left window.

---

### Step 3: Mask & Centerline Extraction

1. Select the relevant case.

2. Click **Start Mask Extraction** to generate color masks. Results will appear in the left window.

3. Review the mask table:
   - Click üí° to view masks for specific colors.
   - ‚ùå indicates undetected masks for that color type.

4. Edit parameters in the table:
   - **Type**, **HSV Value**, and **Action** settings will affect future mask extractions.

5. Save the current configuration by clicking **Save Current**.

6. Click **Start Centerline Extraction** to detect centerlines:
   - Use the table to inspect results for each type of centerline.

7. If results are unsatisfactory, adjust the color table and repeat the process.

### Step 4: Trajectory, Visualization, & G-code Generation

1. Select the relevant case.
   
2. Click **Start Trajectory Planning** to generate cutting trajectories:
   - View the 2D visualization of coarse trajectories at different cutting levels.

3. Use the visualization options:
   - **Original Mesh**: Display the pre-cut mesh.
   - **Target Mesh**: Display the target mesh.

4. Click **Start Animation** to play the cutting animation:
   - Use **Stop** to halt the animation.

5. Generate G-code:
   - Click **Generate Gcode** to create G-code files for CNC execution.

### Additional Notes

Ensure all parameters are fine-tuned during each step for optimal results. Repeat steps as necessary to refine outputs.
